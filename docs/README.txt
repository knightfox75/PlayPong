- What is PlayPong for Playdate?
It is the first game, developed in a week, that I have created to test the development environment and features of the Panic Playdate console. PlayPong is an arcade game for 1 or 2 players, inspired by the classic Atari Pong.

- How to play?
From the initial menu, you can choose the number of players (1 or 2) and in the case of 1 player, whether they will play on the left side of the screen using the directional pad or on the right side using the crank. In two-player mode, player 1 will use the directional pad and player 2 the crank. Buttons A and B are used to accept options and perform the serve action in the game. Once the game mode is selected, the number of points required to win the game must also be selected.

- How was it developed?
It has been programmed using the official Playdate development kit, using the C language. Additionally, the project includes a Visual Studio Code workspace and different scripts to facilitate its compilation on Linux and Windows.
